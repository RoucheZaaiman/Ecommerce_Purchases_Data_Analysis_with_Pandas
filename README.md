# Ecommerce_Purchases_Data_Analysis_with_Pandas

In these exercises I use fundamental Pandas coding to do Data Analysis on Ecommerce Purchases data.  Some interesting calculations done in these exercises are: 

* Finding information on a specific purchase or on the client who made the purchase.
* Determining how many people make use of American Express as their credit card provider.
* Determining the number of cards that expire in the year 2025.
* Determining the top 5 email providers of clients that bought at Amazon.

The data has been put together using other sources and was not sourced from Amazon.  There might be some data that does not make "Real-World" sense.  The data was compiled with the purpose to practice on Ecommerce Purchases using data that resembles real world data.

The exercises was done through Jose Portilla (head of Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy.
